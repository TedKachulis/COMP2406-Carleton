Peaceful Easy Feeling  -Jack Tempchin

[E]I like the w[A]ay your sparkling ea[E]rrings l[A]ay,
A[E]gainst your s[A]kin so b[B7]rown.
I [E]want to sl[A]eep with you in the d[E]esert ton[A]ight,
W[E]ith a million s[A]tars all ar[B7]ound.
(Because) I've got a p[A]eaceful, easy fe[E]eling,
I [A]know you won't let me [F#m]down,[B7]
Because [E]I'm a[F#m]lready sta[A]nding [B7]on the g[E]round.
